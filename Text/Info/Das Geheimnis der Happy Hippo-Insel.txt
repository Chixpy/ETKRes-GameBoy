Das Geheimnis der Happy Hippo Insel ("The Secret of Happy Hippo Island") is based on the Happy Hippo toy figures hidden in the "Kinder Überraschung" ("Kinder Surprise" outside of Germany) chocolate eggs by Italian manufacturer Ferrero.

The game is a platformer spiced up with a few mini games and clearly targeted at younger children. You play Max Mutig ("Max Courageous") and must find out why the Volcano on Happy Hippo Island has suddenly become active again. An important element of the game is collecting water drops and putting out the fires that result from the volcanic eruption. On your way to the volcano you meet several of your Hippo friends who will teach you new skills such as climbing, diving and throwing nuts at dangerous animals.

The game is divided into six areas that consists of three levels each. It is not possible to save the game; instead you get a password after completing each three-level area. This password allows you to start the game at this point later.
