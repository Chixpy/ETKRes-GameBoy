Minesweeper is a minesweeping game, just like the one included in every copy of Microsoft Windows since ancient times. On a grid, you click in a cell and hope that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, you can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, you progress to the next minefield.

Three main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes you to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear.

A second mode is a mission mode, where you are presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in the minefield are revealed from the start, putting your ability of deduction at test.

The final mode allows you to construct a minefield of your own, by inputting parametres of size and amount of bombs. The game can also be played by two players via a link cable.
