Kinnikuman: The Dream Match is a wrestling game based on the Kinnikuman anime series. It features six of some of the most popular characters from the early stages of the saga, these being: Kinnikuman, Terryman, Robin Mask, Ramenman, Brocken Jr. and Warsman.

At the start of the game players can choose any of them and they have to defeat all the others in a random order. During combat the wrester can use punches, "flying kicks" or special moves (for which there is a bar at the bottom of the screen that indicates if they can be used or not).
