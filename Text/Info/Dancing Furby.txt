As a furby you must dance! Woo-teh-loh-wah-boo! Shake it to the left, shake it to the right.

A Furby is an owl-like monster with fluffy pink banana ears. They love to dance, sing, and slowly learn human speech. Specifically a Furby is an autonomous toy robot manufactured by Tiger Electronics, licensor of this game. These toys were among the first successful domestic robots. Here they will be dancing for you. 

Dancing Furby operates as a classic rhythm game, with a line of button prompts scrolling across the screen that you will have to press when they reach the current time mark, supposedly matched with the music.  A Furby on screen will dance in accordance with your performance, commenting on your timing in Furbish, "noo-loo" being perfect, "e-day" being acceptable, and "boo" is shrilled for failure. At the end of each song you'll have you score calculated in "noo-loo"'s etc. and then be allowed to continue.

Successfully clearing a stage will result in you being able to 'connect' the Game Boy's infrared port with the matching port on the forehead of a Furby toy. This will impart information about the song to your furby teaching it to warble Für Elise when you least expect it.

You may also select a Furby to dance with in the game, be it spotted, striped, or lozenge-faced. Good performance will unlock more Furbies.

Songs in the game include Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Für Elise, and a few 'popular' numbers.
