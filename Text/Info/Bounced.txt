Bounced is a arcade platform game in which you play a bouncing ball. In the world of Ditnia all the Dits used to bounce around, until a mysterious evil force field turned them all tired and bounce-less. All except the main character Dito. As Dito you have to bounce to the top of 32 levels, in order to return the status quo. You do do this by bouncing on top of your bounce-less Dits, which gains you kinetic energy. The Dits don't sit around quietly however, so you have to aim well or lose bounce height.
