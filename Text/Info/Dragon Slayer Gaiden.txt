A spin-off from the successful Dragon Slayer series by Falcom, Dragon Slayer Gaiden casts you once again as the nameless knight who must clear dozens of dungeons and save the land from the ever-present dragons.

Gameplay differs somewhat from the original Dragon Slayer in that there are now outdoors areas, as well as npcs that send you on specific quests. Combat is still real-time, but a new attack button brings the game closer to other action-rpgs like Zelda.
