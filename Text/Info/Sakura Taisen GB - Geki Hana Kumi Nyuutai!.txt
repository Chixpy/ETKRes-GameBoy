The first handheld Sakura Taisen game, released between the second and the third mainstream ones, takes place in the original setting: the Imperial Capital in Japan of 1920-ies. It is the Taishou era, time of rapid technological development and acquaintance with Western life style in Japan. Disguised as a group of actresses in the Imperial Theater, the Hanagumi Brigade consists of lovely ladies who are at the same time skilled fighters, able to pilot mechs and to confront the forces of evil that threaten Japan. You are a new commander of Hanagumi (you can name the hero the way you like), who arrives at the theater to work under the guidance of Ichirou Oogami, the main hero of the series, and to lead the beautiful girls Sakura, Sumire, Honglan and others into battle against demons.

The game is a mixture of adventure/"dating sim" and turn-based battles. The RPG element is also present, as the girls fight differently depending on how you treat them. Unlike in other Sakura Taisen games, the battles here are entirely menu-driven. Also, the main plot is unlinear, and you can reach one of the 14 available endings, which also include "bad" ones. You can even get thrown out of the theater for indecent behavior.
