Money Puzzle Exchanger is a puzzle game similar to Magical Drop only with coins. It was originally created by FACE and released for the Neo Geo arcade cabinets.

You can move the mini character at the bottom of the screen left or right, grab coins and drop them somewhere else. There are six types of coins: 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500. The goal is to form connecting groups of coins. Coins are combined (vertically and/or horizontally) to form higher valued coins. For example, if you put five 1 coins together, they will disappear and form one 5 coin. Two 5's make one 10, five 10's make one 50 etc. Two 500 coins put together just disappear and give you 1000 points.

The game is lost when coins reach the bottom of the playing area. You can make chain reactions to launch attacks to the other player in vs-mode, or just for bonus points in single player.
