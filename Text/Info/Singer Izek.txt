A game boy cartridge that could interact with a bundled sewing machine that Singer Co. hoped to use to attract new people to the world of loopers and bobbins. The devices are connected by a link cable that rolls out from inside the sewing machine.

The cartridge contains 84 stitch patterns, including abstract designs, symbols, numbers, and animals such as dolphins. A custom pattern may also be designed. Letters, in block, script, and outline fonts, may also be added to a stitching, ten at a time, the words you use can be added as favorites which can be easily reselected. The patterns can be put together in different combinations.

The cartridge also allows one to do buttonholes, by selecting between five different styles of hole. 

Should something jam on the sewing machine, or some other sort of error occur, a diagram of the machine will appear on the screen with the trouble area flashing. Similarly should the machine require any attention the information will be supplied through the screen.

On the game boy color one can also set the color fabric and thread on the screen.
