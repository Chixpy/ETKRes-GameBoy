Bibi und Tina: Fohlen "Felix" in Gefahr is an action-adventure for children of any age.

In this game, you play the part(s) of Bibi and Tina, two German cartoon stars. In the intro, you discover that the foal Felix has disappeared, apparently stolen, and you set out to find him again. 

This task takes you through six levels. In each level, you play the part of either Bibi or Tina. Be careful, there are enemies which you should not touch – this costs life energy, which can be restored by gathering horseshoes. The task is to find some clue where Felix has gone, as well as finding three sacks of horse food so that you can ride on to the next location. There are several little mini-games you have to master to get some item or clue.

To get to there, there is a side-scrolling arcade sequence where Bibi and Tina are racing each other and where you have to jump obstacles.
