Hanasaka Tenshi Tentenkun no Beat Breaker is a hybrid of the game Simon and a match-3 puzzle game.  Four buttons are required to play - left and right on the Control Pad, and the A and B buttons.  The game screen is split in half.  The top half contains eight columns, followed by a striped line, and then an empty white area.  To the left of the game screen is the time bar.  As you complete rounds, the bar increases.  When the bar reaches the top of the clock, the level is complete.  If your white area fills up beyond the striped lines, the game is over.

Each round has eight notes played in a specific rhythm.  After they are played, they play again, and this time, after each note is played, circles fall down the columns.  Your goal is to press a button when the circles hit the striped line, which turns them into colored circles with either arrows, A or B on them.  These then land in the bin.  If you miss hitting a note, the circles turn into black angry face circles, which are more difficult to clear.  Perform enough beats correctly and happy face circles will appear - these act as wildcards.

When three or more colored circles line up horizontally, they clear from the screen and points are scored.  While you could complete levels by simply pressing the same button in time over and over, the other buttons can be used to set up combos, allowing for bigger points.  In addition, if you press a note incorrectly, sometimes a different button symbol will fall instead, which you must then strategically try to clear.
