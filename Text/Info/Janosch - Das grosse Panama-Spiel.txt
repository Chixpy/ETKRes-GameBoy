A small bear and a small tiger live in their house by a river, minding their own business, when one day a crate is swept ashore from a place called "Panama" with nothing but bananas inside - the favorite food of the two.

Convinced that this "Panama" must be some paradise just bursting with bananas, the two set off to find it. You play the tiger, with the bear at your side, providing needful advice.

In this action/adventure, you have to overcome obstacles, solve puzzles and outsmart evil pirates who have their own plans with those two...

Based on the world created by the popular German childbook author Janosch, this game aims at young children.
