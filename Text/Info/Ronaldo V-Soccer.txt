UEFA 2000 is a officially licensed soccer game for the Game Boy Color. In the game you can play with many national teams. Only the English team has real player names, however. You can play the game in practice, friendly, cup and league mode. Settings include an option to choose between extra time or golden goal (first to score a goal wins). Like any soccer game you can shoot, pass, tackle and make headers. The game comes with three difficulty settings to play with.
