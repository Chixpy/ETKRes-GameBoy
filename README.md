### Icons

Icons are mainly extracted from game screenshots at original resolution. Usually they are protagonist frames or lives icons (if they are similar to protagonist).

All images are png format. Width and Height are variable, using it's original size without resizing to a fixed size or adding more border to make it square. Emuteca handle they automatically.

The only time that the image will be scaled is when all 'icon pixels' are 2x2, 3x3, etc. pixels.

After extracting the icon image with transparent background, a border is added: Middle grey, half transparency (128, 128, 128, 128). Emuteca has a GIMP's script in its distribution, that can add the border automatically after transparent background is created.
